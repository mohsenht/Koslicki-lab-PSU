# Research Direction

{% capture text %}
Computational data-driven research focuses on developing and applying computational methods across various types of omics datasets. Such research is performed in a new type of laboratory, often called a dry lab. Our team designs, develops and applies novel and robust data-driven, computational approaches that will accelerate the diffusion of genomics and biomedical data into translational research and education.
